For me, slipping under the covers is like stepping into a sanctuary, a place where worries fade and the mind can finally rest. The warmth of the blankets, the stillness of the night it's a simple yet exquisite pleasure. Waking up refreshed, ready to greet the day, is just the sweet bonus to the nightly indulgence I so deeply cherish.
